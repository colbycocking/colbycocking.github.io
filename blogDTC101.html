              Something I find interesting is that no matter the era of origin, cultural artifacts can be a point of contention. One of the big topics in the news the last few years has been the Confederate statues that were erected during or after the civil war. People on both sides feel they are in the right for various reasons and regardless of who is correct, the tension still exists.

            An argument that mirrors the statues in its pervasiveness in our society is the battle between iPhone and Android.  The voracity of the patrons associated with these devices belies the relative unimportance of the issue, but the conflict isn’t entirely frivolous. By supporting the device of their choice, these consumers ultimately control the future of the market, so it is paramount that manufacturers make a device that appeals to as many users as possible. Similarly, the conflict around the demolition of historical statues will, to some degree, determine the ideals that are considered socially acceptable. <br><br>
            Because these issues are so important, it is important that we take care of that information and present it in an unbiased method in a curation of sorts. By creating these exhibits, we not only look into the past and see where we have come from, but also see what has and hasn’t worked throughout history so that we don’t make a similar mistake. Because of this, great care should be taken in accurately portraying events as they occurred.

            This can be difficult at times because there may be some information made unavailable by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uiq42O6rhW4" style="color: #FCA423">copyright laws</a>. For this reason, it is important to understand how those laws work and pertain to you and your work. Additionally, fair use may also come into play when open source materials such as googles Android image. <br><br>
            Lastly, some good information to reiterate that old copyrights need to be able to become public domain so that they can be reused and remixed. This is how cultures change over time and grow. Currently, companies such as Disney have a death grip on their copyrights, such that no one can take them and make them their own in any capacity. Furthermore they are trying to increase the length that a copyright may be maintained which  would become a real problem.
