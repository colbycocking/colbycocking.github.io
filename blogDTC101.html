              Digital technology is one of the fastest growing industries of all time. There is an app or a tool or just about anything that you would ever want to do on your phone or computer, but there is one slight drawback. Most technology is designed by men with men in mind. As such, these creations are generally most desired by men. As stated in this <a href=”https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/egm/gst_2010/Schroeder-EP.13-EGM-ST.pdf” style="color:#FCA423">expert paper</a> on gender dimensions. But these concepts expand to things much outside the realm of technology. For me, one of the most prominent examples that comes to mind is the type of games people enjoy. <br><br>
              My wife and I love board games. My wife and I do not love the same board games. Growing up, I was always a huge fan of strategy and games were fun, in part because of the opportunity to claim mental dominance over another. The point is to win, and with the exception of cheating, no holds barred. Little did I know, that is not how or why many other people play games. <br><br>
              On the other side of the spectrum, for people like my wife, games offer a completely different experience. It becomes more of a social event and though there might be winners and losers, in the end, everyone is a winner because we all had fun and got to spend time with one another. I make no claim that women lack the predisposition to be competitive, but in my personal experience, this is the norm when it come to games. But board games are not the only place in which we see this reoccurring theme, it occurs a lot in video games as well. If game companies are interested in attracting more members of team female, it might behoove them to start highlighting some of the social aspects of gaming in an attempt to broaden their customer base, especially now that the <a href=”https://www.forbes.com/sites/annatobin/2018/10/11/is-mobile-phone-gaming-taking-over-from-console-gaming/#d965c56da3d8” style="color:#FCA423">advent of mobile gaming</a> is upon us.  <br><br>

            I have been in the market for a new cell phone for a while. Partly because I struggle with parting with the exorbitant amount of cash that a cell phone costs 
            anymore, and partly because I like to take my time when purchasing new electronic devices. Phones are a big purchase and though many companies would like you 
            to think that you should get a new one every year, I am inclined to think that something that costs more than my computer shouldn’t be replaced annually. So, 
            I do a lot of research and see which of the phones best suit my need. I will wait until a few months after a flagship release and read reviews, so I know that 
            I am getting the device that is most suited to my needs. I have even delayed getting a phone to see what new offerings will be available during the next release 
            cycle, all in the name of getting the perfect phone with all the specifications I want. <br><br>
            This is not how my wife shops for a phone. She will walk into Verizon and pick up the newest generation of iPhone and be on here way. The hardest decision 
            of the entire ordeal for her is what color she wants. That is because she doesn’t care about the bells and whistles. She is buying an iPhone for the familiarity 
            and ease of use because for her, the phone is just a way to stay in touch with people and she doesn’t want to have to learn an entire new operating system to 
            do that. <br><br>
            In recent years, many efforts have been made to narrow the deficit between men and women who use technology in their daily lives. These efforts are gaining 
            traction as companies are starting to realize the potential gains, not only in the market sector, but for public image. It is a slow process to start, but I
             believe that as more people start to think inclusively in the field of design, its quite possible that many products, who’s growth has become stagnant, will
              see a resurgence in use and possible a new niche. What is something that you feel could be tweaked just a little to improve its appeal to different user groups?
