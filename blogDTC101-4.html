                Growing up in the 90’s was much different than growing up in the 10’s. Television and radio were the primary sources of news, political and otherwise. 
                One of the biggest scandals I remember growing up was the Clinton incident and
                  one thing that I remember a distinct lack of, was this vitriol that we see slathered online like verbal warfare. Sure, people got into debates
                   on the ethics of certain practices and global warming was starting to become a big thing, but people were civil to one another.

                Fast forward to 2016. Donald Trump, not yet elected president, is rumored to be colluding with the Russian government to get dirt on political rivals.
                 Not only this, but there was a story about him cheating on his wife in Russia with several “escorts” on top of all of the overtly offensive things 
                 that spew from his maw. On the other side of the spectrum, we have candidates who are accused of keeping classified documents on private computers 
                 and questionable sums of money being received for speaking fees. <br><br>
                
                Disregarding which of these rumors are true and which are false, we can see a definite pattern of really unsettling stories, but the problem is, 
                maybe not all of them are true. Problematically, it doesn’t seem to really matter if these accusations hold true or not because of the social media
                 platforms used by billions of people around the world. <br><br>
                The issue is that people react to their feelings before thinking through situations logically. Trolls and even foreign cyber actors can use this 
                natural response to propagate false news because a huge portion of the users on these sites don’t do any fact checking or research of their own to 
                determine the validity of these claims. That’s because of a phenomenon known
                 as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xKklLplngs" style="color: #FCA423">confirmation bias</a>. If a story confirms or supports what you believe, 
                then why would you question it? Problematically, this is how we get so many fake news stories around.

            Another issue that stems from social media platform is the polarization of our pollical spectrum. I remember my parents talking politics with friends when 
            I was a kid. They didn’t always whole heartedly agree on each topic, but they were able to compromise on their ideas because they would create a dialogue. 
            This contrasts sharply with today because the dialogue is gone. When I think of politics in today’s society, I just see a bunch of people with signs all lined 
            up and screaming at one another not caring what the other person has to say. It’s disheartening to say the least. We need to do away with just a little bit of 
            the customization of platforms like Facebook so that maybe our lives aren't quite so black and white.
