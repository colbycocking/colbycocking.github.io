                How would you like to be rated on every personal interaction that you have? It’s a simple system, just a 1 to 5 star scale based on your attitude,
                 clothing choice, word choice, eye contact, smile, and even those who you choose to interact with. Better yet, let’s up the intensity a bit and say 
                 that those ratings have the ability to get you a discount on your apartment and even swing you into the fast lane at the airport! This is the idea 
                 put before you in an episode of Netflix’s Black Mirror series titled 
                 <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5497778/" style="color: #FCA423">Nosedive</a><br><br>
                At the start of the episode, we are introduced to the main character, a woman in her mid-thirties, who seems to be living a relatively happy 
                and active lifestyle in what appears to be a utopian society. As the film progresses, our protagonist Lacie, goes through various social interactions 
                throughout the day, each netting her social rating points and making her feel good about herself, but it doesn’t take long for things to turn dystopic.

            In a scene that takes place at her office, we find a man begging for 5 star ratings because he has suddenly come into a bit of bad luck with his social score. You see, he and his lover had a spat and parted ways and the entirety of the office is siding with his ex. As a result, he has been receiving negative feedback from everyone in the office and his score has plummeted. The next day, we again see this character standing outside his place of employment because he can’t get in. Why might you ask? Well, it seems that his social score has dropped below and acceptable level to enter the building effectively terminating his employment. That’s right! He got fired because of a breakup and while you may be thinking, well that would never happen, I urge you to reconsider.

            <p> Since 2014, China has been experimenting with a system almost identical to the black mirror system with small test groups in their population.
                 The call it a <a href="https://gizmodo.com/china-s-social-ranking-system-is-getting-closer-to-beco-1830612936" style="color: #FCA423">social credit system</a> and claim
                  that the intent behind the program is to keep everyone honest. I take issue with this because honesty isn’t the only thing that they are scored on.
                   There are penalties for things such as poor driving and smoking in a non-smoking zone. These might seem relatively innocuous at first, but as you diver
                    further, you might find that you can take a hit on your karma credit by simply buying too many video games. According to Gizmod, this system has already
                     blocked 11 million individuals from flying and 4 million from using high-speed trains and that isn’t the worst part. <br><br></p>
                     Currently we are unsure if this score is an amalgam or conglomerate value. The problem is, all of the internal workings of the system have been kept secret.
                      Can you imagine attempting to buy a home and being told that you would not be able to complete the transaction because you had too many traffic violations? 
                      The idea seems ridiculous, but China claims that they may launch this system nationally as early as 2021 and that is terrifying. <br><br>
                    Imagine for a moment that you found out some horrible government secret and you decide to try and go public with it. It’s entirely possible that the government 
                could tank your score through false defamation of various kinds. Since this system is supposed to grade you on your honesty, you are now labeled as someone who 
                spreads false news and lies to the point that no one believes you. This could also be used to sabotage others when attempting to find employment and if hackers 
                are ever able to exploit this system, it’s going to be a catastrophe.
