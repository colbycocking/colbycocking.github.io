                What goes on your resume? Your name, contact info, education, your last few jobs and some skills. If you are skilled with words, you can get in
                a few highlights for each position, but generally not everything that you want and what about those things that don’t really fit into a category 
                on a resume, but are important accomplishments or achievements? I know when I am looking for a job, I know that as good as my resume is, its still 
                just a white piece of paper just like everyone else’s. Now, what if I told you there is a way of putting more on a resume without using smaller font 
                or a larger sheet of paper. The secret to conveying everything you need to an employer is a personal website. 
                Having your very own page on the web can be a huge hiring advantage for anyone and with so many places to create one, such as wix.com, there really 
                isn’t an excuse to not have one. <br><br>
                I know what your thinking, “I already have a Facebook, Tumbler and Twitter account. Why do I need another place on the internet to post my accomplishments?”. 
                While having your business information on social media is one way of communicating information to potential employers, I would argue that it’s a poor way of going about 
                it. This year, the number of active Facebook users has risen to nearly 2.5 Billion. Earth is currently home to 7.5 Billion people, so if your goal was to stand out, you 
                failed. Additionally, maybe they found someone with the same name by accident and that person is not quite the outstanding citizen that you are. Having your own website 
                will help you get noticed, but that’s not the only reason its useful. <br><br>
                One of the most important aspects of developing your own internet location is the freedom it gives you to control how others see you. This is your opportunity to get 
                creative and express yourself while still conveying relevant information in a professional manner. Include a photo so that if someone visits your website before meeting 
                with you, they will already recognize you and have a fairly reasonable idea who you are and what you offer. As your career grows and you incorporate more and more of
                 your accomplishments into your site, you start establishing your ‘brand’. <br><br>
                Your ‘brand’ is important, but it must be established over time. The best way to do this is to include examples of your work on the website but being selective is key. 
                Put your truly great work up for display, but make sure that any shoddy work is left offline. Remember, you control your image, so its important that you find those pro
                jects that truly define you at your best. If you are in a computer science related field, you could go a step further and design your website from the ground up. It is 
                more work, but ultimately worth it when you are trying to show off your skills. Just don't forget that this site is a reflection of you, so if your CSS and HTML
                look like these two sites, you might try wordpress first. <br><br>

              Yes, that is the same Suzanne Collins that wrote the Hunger Games and frankly, I am astonished. As a professional, I would be embarrassed if this is what people
               saw when they googled me. I’m also having a hard time figuring out why the art school at Yale has a website that looks like a kaleidoscope of the hallway and why
                neither of these debacles have been rectified. The point is, if this is what your CSS is like, just use a service until you get a little more practice. Alternatively
                you could use a content management system.</p>

                A CMS is a program that aids in designing a website. Its somewhere in the middle of website builders and static HTML. It offers a way to build a website without having to
                know how to code. Applications such as wordpress provide more flexibility than using a website builder, but there is a higher learning curve. Many companies higher
                a web developer just to run their wordpress site, so it can still be a challenge for some.<br><br>
              Once you have decided on the method of your website, sit down and get to work. There are many places on the web that offer example pages, free imagery and 
              anything else you might need to get started. Your reputation is important, so why not start establishing the you that you want to be.
